Despite its popularity, there are many well-known issues with the Amazon-owned website which have persisted for years since its creation. There are well documented issues with review-bombing, or flooding books with negative reviews in response to perceived bad behaviour from the author, as a result of targeted racist or sexist campaigns, or as a way of blackmailing authors into paying a 'ransom' to prevent their book from getting buried by bad reviews [1]. User forums are rife with reports of malicious reviews affecting both authors and users, reports of website issues, and with complaints about a lack of moderation on the website [2]. When Amazon bought the website in 2013 they initially attempted to increase moderation and adjust policies, but their approach was widely considered to be clumsy and unsuccessful [3]. Massive user backlash followed, and since then Amazon seems to have opted for the opposite extreme, only lightly moderating and taking a hands-off approach.\n","\n","Many users acknowledge that the ratings system, although it has been improved over the years, is imperfect as it tends to average out at between 4 and 5 stars for most books. This is often colloquially referred to by booksellers and publishers as the 'Goodreads Effect', where ratings tend to hover around 3 to 4 stars and are not considered reliable, especially as a book becomes more popular.\n","\n","This means potential readers cannot rely on the 5-star rating system when deciding whether they would like to read a book or not. It is also a very one-dimensional approach to rating media, which may be complex and have many different features, and is very subjective depending on how readers choose to use the rating system. For example, some readers may rate a longer book lower on the scale because they did not like how long it was; A potential reader of that book may see the lower ratings and avoid the book despite having a preference for longer books, because they don't know why the book has been rated lower. Analysing reviews on a deeper level could help avoid this, and could also help identify instances where the majority of user reviews are not related to the book, as in cases of harassment campaigns targeted at authors.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d69ad5ae","metadata":{"id":"d69ad5ae"},"source":["Despite these known issues, many people use Goodreads as a main source of information when deciding whether to purchase or read a book.

Some book pages will load with the new layout some of the time, with no perceivable pattern as to when or why this will happen. My code was written for the older, stable version, with the reasoning that they may change the new design multiple times before final implementation. When newer versions of the page are loaded, the code will wait a set amount of time and then reload the page until the old version appears. This adds a significant delay to the run time, but without being able to determine when the new vs old version will load this is the only way around the issue at present."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"07fbc1a1","metadata":{"id":"07fbc1a1"},"source":["## 3.

As expected, the strongest correlation for Rank was with Rating Count, meaning those books that are read more often move further up the list.\n","- Award Count and Rating Count have a small positive correlation, meaning that the number of awards a book has won may increase its popularity and make it more likely to be listed as 'Read' by a user. There is also a smaller positive correlation between Award Count and Score/Votes. However, this may simply mean that popular books on the website are more likely to be updated with a list of awards.\n","- Genre Count has a small negative correlation with Average Rating and Rank, which may indicate that users prefer books which are more clearly placed in one genre over books which spread across multiple genres.\n","- Page Count seems to have minimal effect, meaning users do not seem to have a preference for longer or shorter books overall\n","- Character Count also seems to have a small correlation with Average Rating, but not enough to definitively conclude that users prefer books with more characters.

Lists could be improved by changing the layout to show more books at once (perhaps in a grid rather than a traditional list) and by adding a 'Vote for this Book in x List' segment on individual book pages. This would allow a more seamless link between Lists and Book Detail pages.\n","- A standard list of genres, with a set process for adding new genres to the list, could be needed. The current system is not necessarily helpful for users. Some competitor websites like StoryGraph have implemented 'trope' and 'subject' lists alongside genre to better assist users in understanding a book's topic.\n","- The publication dates and genres of popular books can help us make inferences about the demographics of the Goodreads user base and what motivates them. Many users seem motivated by nostalgia for Young Adult books they may have read in their youth, and will rate them higher than newer books. Users tend to rate books published in the last 10 years higher overall."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2531d9b0","metadata":{"id":"2531d9b0"},"source":["The main conclusion from my analysis, unfortunately, was to support the claim made by many users that the website needs significant updates in order to function as intended.

It seems that the List system on Goodreads serves to reinforce user preferences without challenging or offering potential new options to users - a common criticism of the website overall. Since it is owned by Amazon, a key path to making the website more profitable would seem to be moving away from showing users books they already like and towards showing them books they might like by way of a recommendation system, but it seems that for whatever reason this has not been explored or implemented.\n","\n","The rating system does seem to average out around 4 stars for the most popular books, and doesn't provide much additional information to potential readers.

Popular books seem more likely to have Character and Genre data, indicating that only the more popular book pages are being updated regularly. This makes Goodreads' claim of functioning as a book 'database' seem dubious, as those less popular books are more likely to have incorrect or missing information. This could be resolved by drawing book information from another system, for example from Amazon or some other library of book information. The only integration between the two websites seems to be the 'Get a Copy' section on the Book Details pages, which links to an Amazon page where users can purchase the book.
