This repo containts files and code used for a data science project I completed for my MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of London.

The code was used to conduct analysis of data on Goodreads, including user-submitted reviews. You can read the final papers or view the code.

I include the code snippets to help anyone else who is interested in scraping data from Goodreads, since they have discontinued their API.
